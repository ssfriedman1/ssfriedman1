### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Spencer Friedman!

---
Informatics and Biochemistry student exploring the intersection of my two passions, looking to solve today's greatest health issues by harnassing the power of data. 

I hope to use this GitHub page to display the story of my exploration of Informatics and the Life Sciences in a way that others can learn from the work that I've done.
